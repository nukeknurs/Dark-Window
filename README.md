# But why?

Imagine that it's night, you play some sweet-crazy-action game, have 2 (or more) monitors, **BUT** instead of turning one off you want to keep an eye on mails, task manager and some videos :crab: + you just hate Dark-Mode. 

## How it works?

Just click the GIF below to get the newest executable ready to launch and run it, that's all! 

If you want to change color, transparency or sth else use `Dark Window.py` script. You know the gig. :sweat_smile:
